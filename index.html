                    Everything in this world has a purpose. It might seem worthless, but the fact is that everyone plays a vital role in this Earth. People should appreciate what they have and always be grateful. As human beings, we are different in many ways. We are all created by the same God, but we do have some variations. Not all things are perfect, adorable and probably the best. But trust me; there is only that one thing that makes one to be exceptional, regardless of a family background and other problems. Everyone is unique and gifted in some way. <span id="b"> Man, woman, black, white, Asian, no matter what your race or gender are. </span> <span id="bg">We should stand together to turn the world into a better place that will be meaningful.

                                Sharing your own ideas encourages others to do the same, leading in a more productive and positive environment to everyone. The process of collaborating and brainstorming on a more or less topic or a related problem is known as idea sharing. It could be about constructing innovative policies or striving to enhance existing ones.

                        We all can be leaders. In fact, women leaders are a need of the 21st century. For women to be more productive and reveal their underlying potential, it is important for the modern society to empower them with leadership roles, thus encouraging diversity. Since it is a difficult task, it requires support and cooperation from every person in the society.
